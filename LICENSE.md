# Data Use Agreement – PhysioMio Surface EMG Dataset

This Agreement sets the conditions for accessing the PhysioMio Surface
Electromyography (sEMG) dataset containing de‑identified recordings from
post‑stroke participants.

**All handling of the Dataset must comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all other applicable data‑protection laws.**

By downloading or using the Dataset, the Recipient agrees to all terms below.

1. **DEFINITIONS**

   * **Dataset** – all sEMG files, metadata, and documentation supplied here.
   * **Data Provider** – the PhysioMio research team.
   * **Recipient** – the individual or organisation that receives access.
   * **Research Use** – any bona‑fide internal research and development aimed at
     advancing scientific or technical knowledge.

2. **PERMITTED USES**

   The Recipient may store, analyse, and create derivative works or trained models
   from the Dataset **for Research Use only**, provided that:

   * the Recipient has obtained approval from a competent ethics commission /
     Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the intended research;
   * derivatives contain no information that could reasonably re‑identify
     individual participants;
   * all publications or products cite the Dataset as specified in §5.

3. **PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES**

   The Recipient shall **NOT**:

   * attempt to re‑identify participants or link the Dataset with other data for that purpose;
   * redistribute the Dataset (in whole or part) to anyone not bound by this Agreement; or
   * violate any applicable law or ethics regulation in handling the data.

4. **DATA SECURITY & GDPR COMPLIANCE**

   The Recipient must:

   * handle and process the Dataset in full accordance with the GDPR and relevant
     local data‑protection laws;
   * store the Dataset on secured, access‑controlled systems;
   * limit access to personnel who have read and agreed to this Agreement;
   * promptly inform the Data Provider at [julian.ilg@tum.de](mailto:julian.ilg@tum.de)
     if the Recipient believes any part of the Dataset might permit the identification
     of an individual or institution, citing the specific file and location of
     that information;
   * notify the Data Provider at [julian.ilg@tum.de](mailto:julian.ilg@tum.de)
     without delay if any unauthorised access, loss, or breach is suspected; and
   * delete local copies upon completion of the project or at the Data Provider’s
     written request.

5. **PUBLICATION & ATTRIBUTION**

   * Do not include raw data or identifiable information in public outputs.
   * Cite the Dataset and the associated PhysioMio data descriptor in all publications
     or presentations.

6. **WARRANTY & LIABILITY**

   The Dataset is provided **“as is.”** The Data Provider disclaims all warranties
   and is not liable for any direct or indirect damages arising from its use.
   The Recipient indemnifies the Data Provider for claims resulting from misuse.

7. **TERMINATION**

   This Agreement remains in force until the Recipient deletes the Dataset.
   The Data Provider may terminate access immediately for breach. Obligations
   regarding privacy, security, and attribution survive termination.

8. **GOVERNING LAW**

   This Agreement is governed by German law. Exclusive jurisdiction lies with
   the courts of Munich, Germany.

## Access mechanism (informative, not contractual)

The Dataset is hosted in a *gated* Hugging Face repository. Approval is granted
once the applicant:

* identifies themselves (username, name, affiliation, email);
* **provides a one-line statement of the general purpose of the intended research**; and
* affirms that they have read and will comply with this Agreement.

No project‑proposal review, fee, or co‑authorship is required.

*By requesting access, you confirm you have read, understood, and agree to the above terms.*
